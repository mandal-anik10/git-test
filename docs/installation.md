# Installation:
- Clone the repository in your computer and move to the repository:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/mandal-anik10/unipy.git
    $ cd unipy  
    ```
- Now you should have a shell prompt ready in the `unipy` folder, and by running `$ ls` you should see a folder again called `unipy`. You can then install `unipy` with:
    ```
    $ python setup.py install
    ```
